We use FontAwesome. If you can use a fa-icon (instead of text) use a fa-icon. Always strive to keep the UI modern, beautiful, and minimalistic. Shy away from using too many colors, borders, glow, and animations.

Never write "Loading" - always show a loading placeholder (or a loading spinner, when appropriate).
